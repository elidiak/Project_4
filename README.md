# Final Project
## Predicting Energy Consumption based on Weather Forecasts
#### Team Members: Chris Kellam, Eric Lidiak, Matthew Smith, Molly Fox, Jason Britton
DESCRIPTION: Create a predictive model based on historical weather and energy consumption data to forecast energy consumption based on weather variables such as minimum, maximum and average temperature, state, and month of year. 

RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 
- What types of historical data are available for weather and energy consumption?
- Is weather data a good predictor of energy consumption?
- How do different modelsâ€™ compare to one another for time-series prediction?
